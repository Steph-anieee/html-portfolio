  only female child,middle child of two brothers, Lost my mom(dad's mom),my favourite person on my 10th birthday.

    These values guide my actions and decision.My family,Dreams, and Goals motivates Me.The sense of belonging and making them PROUD fuels my journey</p>

<p>My family is my rock! I cherish My younger brother,Aunties(especially Auntie Lina and Naa Ayorkor),MY Dad,
  Uncle Ernest(Auntie Ayorkor's husband)-he's one of the kindest people to ever exist, and people like that are rare to find.
   My adorable little siblings(Cousins)(Mimi and Micky) are precious to me. They're all my support system,and I'm grateful for their love.
   My goal and aspirations are also close to my heart.</p> 


<p>I hate being shouted at. I prefer calm communication,even when I'm at fault.just find a way to talk to me calmly.
  when people shout ,speak rudely or misunderstand me in a negative way, i get angry and often end up crying.i try to control my
  emotions,but my facial experssions often given me away.</p>
